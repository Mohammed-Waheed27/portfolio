# Image Requirements for Portfolio Website

## Profile Picture
To use your selfie as your profile picture:
1. Save the selfie image you provided (mirror selfie with jacket) as `profile.jpg`
2. Place it in the `img` folder
3. Make sure the image is square or close to square for best results

## Project Images
The portfolio needs images for your projects. You have two options:

### Option 1: Generate Project Images
You can generate professional project images using AI image generators like:
- DALL-E
- Midjourney
- Stable Diffusion

**Suggested prompts for project images:**
- Project 1 (ToDo App): "Minimalist mobile app UI showing a todo list with tasks, dark purple theme"
- Project 2 (Crypto App): "Cryptocurrency dashboard mobile UI with charts and graphs, dark mode"
- Project 3 (Habit Tracker): "Mobile app UI showing habit tracking calendar and statistics, purple theme"
- Project 4 (E-Commerce): "Mobile e-commerce app UI with product grid, shopping cart, dark theme"
- Project 5 (Chat App): "Modern messaging app interface with chat bubbles, dark purple theme"
- Project 6 (Weather App): "Weather forecast mobile app UI with gradient background and weather icons"

### Option 2: Use Screenshots
If you have actual screenshots of your apps:
1. Take screenshots of your applications
2. Crop them to a 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio
3. Ensure they're clear and showcase the UI well

## Image Requirements
For all images:

1. **Names**: Save the images as:
   - `profile.jpg` (for your profile picture)
   - `project1.jpg`, `project2.jpg`, `project3.jpg`, etc. (for project screenshots)

2. **Location**: All images should be placed in the `img` folder

3. **Formats**: JPG or PNG formats work best

4. **Size**:
   - Profile photo: 500x500px recommended (square)
   - Project images: 800x600px or 1200x800px recommended

5. **Optimizations**:
   - Keep file sizes under 300KB each for better performance
   - Ensure images are clear and not pixelated

Your website's appearance will greatly improve with high-quality images that match the new dark purple color scheme!
